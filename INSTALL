MPFC depends on several libraries. To build MPFC you will need to install development packages for:
  * ncursesw
  * gpm
  * gstreamer and gstreamer-plugins-base (version 1.x)
  * taglib_c (C bindings for TagLib)
  * json-glib

After you have installed them just issue:
  $ ./configure [--prefix=<where-to-install>] && make

Then (as root):
  # make install
  # ldconfig 

The last command is required on some systems to update the shared libraries cache.
